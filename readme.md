# RandomBootAnimation

This script aims to set a random Bootanimation each time it is started (for example at boot).
Just put some bootanimations in the "Bootanimations" folder in the root (the "main folder") of the main memory.
You must provvide non flashable zips, they should contain just part.txt and a few folders named something like partXX.
**This script must be executed as root or it will not work so rooting your Android device is required.**
