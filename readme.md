# RandomBootAnimation

This script aims to set a random Bootanimation each time it is started (for example at boot).
Just put some bootanimations in the "Bootanimations" folder in the root (the "main folder") of the main memory.
**Note: You have to provvide non flashable zips, they should contain just part.txt and a few folders named something like partXX**
